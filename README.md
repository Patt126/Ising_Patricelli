## Benchmarking Strategies for Parallel 2D Ising Model Simulation     
This project implements the Ising model simulation using C++ and offers parallel computation using  OpenMP (for multicore CPUs),. It models the magnetic dipole moments of atomic "spins" on a lattice, simulating phase transitions in ferromagnetic materials.

## Features

- 2D Ising Model simulation with periodic boundary conditions.
- Serial computation with C++ with  Metropolis-Hastings alghoritm.
-  parallel computation utilizing OpenMP with different parallelization techniques.
- Configurable parameters such as lattice size, temperature range, and number of iterations.
- Analysis of physical properties like total energy, magnetization, correlation lenght and specific heat. Following their evolution with temperature around the critical one.
- Performance evaluation for benchmarking with fixed number of iteration.
- Convergence criterion implementation: exact solution comparison and fluctuation analisys.
- Visualization
